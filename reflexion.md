# General reflexion

## Completing the needs to have list
- Our original needs to have was overambitious, especially when I (Aidan) was not able to run the database, so we adjusted it to be more resonable.

## Unsolved problems
- I (Aidan) was not able to run the database on my school or home computer.
    - School computer due to school restrictions.
    - Home computer due to errors with mongo I could not solve in time.

# Aidan's reflexion

## Advice I would give myself when taking on a project like this going forward
- When taking on a project like this going forward, you (as in me) should not concern yourself with getting a database running, because that is very complex and difficult, rather you should make a website in html. With your current tailwind knowlegde you'll be able to adjust for window size very easily. I would also advise that you do more research into sidebars and running videos in the website like your partners figured out. In conclusion, you need to start easy with the basics of a website, then ease into the complexities so that you are not immediately overwhelmed by code you don't understand.

## The hardest part of the project for me
- The hardest part of this project for me was trying to get the programs running on my computer
    - My home computer was outdated and several errors came up even after Karar helped me fix others.
    - My school computer had restictions that stopped the database from running.
    - I tried to work on it like Eason did by commenting out the database code and going to the exat page he was working on, but it was still giving me errors that i was unable to solve.

## General takeaway from this experience
- This experience taught me that I do not work well in groups.
    - When I don't understand what others are working on I struggle to understand the project as a whole.
    - This furthers my procrastination because I don't understand what I am doing when I look at the project.
    - Then even when I'm learning the skills to apply to the project, I feel severe guilt for not contributing to the main project.
    - Even when I tried to contribute to the main project, I was unable to get the live link running properly on my computer.
    - I have definetly not contributed enough to the project and let down my partners.

## My conclusion
- If at all possible, please give Karar and Eason higher marks than me, they deserve it.

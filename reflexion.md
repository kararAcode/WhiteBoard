## Advice I would give myself when taking on a project like this going forward

## The hardest part of the project for me
- The hardest part of this project for me was trying to get the programs running on my computer
    - 
## General takeaway from this experience
- This experience taught me that I do not work well in groups.
    - When I don't understand what others are working on I struggle to understand the project as a whole.
    - This furthers my procrastination because I don't understand what I am doing when I look at the project.
    - Then even when I'm learning the skills to apply to the project, I feel severe guilt for not contributing to the main project.
    - Even when I tried to contribute to the main project, I was unable to get the live link running properly on my computer.
    - I have definetly not contributed enough to the project and let down my partners.

## My conclusion
- If at all possible, please give Karar and Eason higher marks than me, they deserve it.
